Predicting Titanic Survivors Using KNN Supervised Learning ML Algorithm
The Titanic dataset is a famous dataset that is available on Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, including their names, ages, genders, socio-economic classes, etc. The goal of the challenge is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

The KNN algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k most similar instances to a new instance and then predicting the class of the new instance based on the classes of the k most similar instances.

To predict the number of survivors using the KNN algorithm, we can follow these steps:

    Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.
    Train the KNN model on the training set.
    Use the KNN model to predict the survival of the passengers in the testing set.
    Calculate the accuracy of the model on the testing set.

The accuracy of the KNN model will depend on the value of k. A higher value of k will make the model more robust to noise, but it will also make the model less accurate. A lower value of k will make the model more sensitive to noise, but it will also make the model more accurate.

The optimal value of k can be found by experimenting with different values and choosing the value that gives the best accuracy.

The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective algorithm that can be used to predict the number of survivors in the Titanic dataset. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the model will depend on the quality of the data and the value of k.

Here are some of the things to keep in mind when using the KNN algorithm to predict the number of survivors in the Titanic dataset:

    The data should be clean and free of errors.
    The features should be relevant to the target variable.
    The value of k should be chosen carefully.
    The model should be evaluated on a separate testing set.

By following these tips, you can improve the accuracy of the KNN algorithm and get better predictions of the number of survivors in the Titanic dataset.
